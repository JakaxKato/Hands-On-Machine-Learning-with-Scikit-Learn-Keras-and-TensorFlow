(English, structured, with figure placements)

1. What Is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is defined as the science and art of programming computers to learn from data.
Arthur Samuel (1959) describes ML as the field that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Tom Mitchell (1997) provides an operational definition:
A program learns from experience (E) on task (T) with performance metric (P) if its performance on T improves with E.

A spam filter is a practical example:

Task (T): classify emails as spam or ham

Experience (E): past labeled emails

Performance (P): accuracy

Downloading data (e.g., Wikipedia) is not ML unless performance on a task improves.

2. Why Use Machine Learning?
Traditional Rule-Based Programming

Writing a spam filter manually requires crafting many rules such as detecting specific words (“4U”, “credit card”, “free”).
This results in long, fragile, and hard-to-maintain code.

![Figure 1-1: Traditional rule-based approach](../images/ch1/figure1-1.png)
(Figure shows a manual rule-writing process: study problem → write rules → test → launch.)

ML-Based Approach

A Machine Learning spam filter automatically learns which words/phrases are predictive of spam by analyzing patterns in labeled emails.

(Figure shows: provide data → train ML algorithm → evaluate → launch.)

ML is easier to update, more scalable, and more adaptive.

Automatic Adaptation to New Patterns

If spammers modify wording (“4U” → “For U”), rule-based programs must be manually updated.
ML systems adapt automatically by learning from new examples.

![Figure 1-3: Automatically adapting to change](../images/ch1/figure1-3.png)
(Figure shows the system updating itself when new spam patterns emerge.)

ML for Complex or Unsolvable Problems

Some tasks—like large-vocabulary speech recognition—are too complex for hand-crafted rules.
ML is also used for discovering patterns in data (data mining).

ML Helps Humans Learn

By analyzing models (e.g., spam classifier weights), humans can discover correlations and insights.

3. Summary of ML Benefits

ML excels when:

Manual rules are too complex or numerous

No known algorithm exists

Environments change frequently

Insights need to be extracted from large datasets

5. Types of Machine Learning Systems

ML systems are categorized by:

A. Supervision Level

Supervised Learning: training data includes labels

Classification (e.g., spam detection)

Regression (predict numeric values)

![Figure 1-5: Labeled training set](../images/ch1/figure1-5.png)

Insert Figure 1-6 — Regression example
![Figure 1-6: Regression problem](../images/ch1/figure1-6.png)

Algorithms: k-NN, Linear/Logistic Regression, SVMs, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks.

Unsupervised Learning: no labels

Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, HCA)

Dimensionality reduction (PCA, LLE, t-SNE)

Anomaly detection

Association rule learning

Semisupervised Learning: mostly unlabeled data + a few labels
(e.g., Google Photos automatic face grouping)

Insert Figure 1-11 — Semisupervised learning

Reinforcement Learning: an agent takes actions to maximize cumulative reward

B. Batch vs. Online Learning

Batch learning: trained offline, heavy computation

Online learning: continuously learns from data streams
Useful for rapidly changing environments

C. Instance-Based vs. Model-Based

Instance-based: compares new data to stored examples

Model-based: learns a general model (e.g., linear regression)

Conclusion

Chapter 1 introduces the essential ideas of Machine Learning, explains why ML is needed, highlights real-world applications, and classifies ML systems by their learning type and behavior.
It establishes the conceptual foundation for the rest of the book.
